## 🚀 Getting Started

To set up this repository on your machine, run the following commands in your terminal:

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Zeaxanthin80/CAI2840C.git
```
### 2️⃣ Navigate to the repository
```sh
cd CAI2840C_Computer_Vision
```
### 3️⃣ Install the required dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4️⃣ Open Jupyter Notebook
```sh
jupyter notebook
```

## 📝 Notes
Each week's folder contains the respective Jupyter Notebook and any associated resources.
Some notebooks may require additional dependencies. Install them using
```sh
# If using a virtual enviroment, skip this step to the next section below.
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔧 Virtual Environment 
For easier dependency management, consider creating a virtual environment. You can do this with:
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```
Then, install the dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 📦 Large datasets are not included in the repository. 
You can download them from the course materials or specified sources.

### 🔗 Colab Link 
![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)

To add the colab link so that it appears at the top of the notebook in the GitHub code preview page follow the steps below.

Steps to save file with the colab link in GitHub

1. Open the file in colab
2. Rename the file using COURSE_YYYYMMDD_Week_XX.ipynb format
3. Save to GitHub via the File > Save dialog box and make sure the "Include a link to Colab" box is selected.
4. (Optional) Initiate a Pull request with VS Code to work on file locally.
