    "**Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience with OpenCV by building three applications in a Google Colab notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Video I/O Application:** Read from and write to a video stream. You can modify or extend the code we used in class.\n",
    "2. **Motion Detection Application:** Develop a motion detection system that explains the concepts of foreground mass (the difference between the background model and the current frame) and erosion (a morphological operation used to remove noise). You should demonstrate erosion on a new video clip.\n",
    "3. **Contour Detection Application:** Write code that identifies and draws contours on an image. For extra credit, extend your solution to detect and draw contours in a video (with a clip that is less than one minute long)."

    "## Part 1: Video I/O Application\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:** Use any video file of your choice (or create one, e.g., using your webcam or a synthetic video clip that is less than 1 minute long).\n",
    "- **Processing:** Implement a simple transformation on each frame (this can be as basic as converting to grayscale, overlaying text, or drawing shapes).\n",
    "- **Output:** Write the processed frames to a new video file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reading the Video:**\n",
    "    - Use cv2.VideoCapture to open the video file.\n",
    "    - Loop through each frame and perform your processing.\n",
    "2. **Processing the Frames:**\n",
    "    - Apply your chosen transformation (for example, add a timestamp overlay or convert to grayscale).\n",
    "3. **Writing the Video:**\n",
    "    - Use cv2.VideoWriter to create an output video file.\n",
    "    - Write the processed frames to this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Ensure your output video settings (frame size, codec, and frame rate) match the input video."

    "\n",
    "- **Input:** Use a video clip (less than one minute long) that shows some movement.\n",
    "- **Processing:**\n",
    "    - Create a **background model** from the initial frames.\n",
    "    - Compute the **foreground mass** by taking the difference between the current frame and the background model.\n",
    "    - Apply **erosion** to the foreground mask to remove noise (explain how erosion removes small, isolated noise pixels).\n",
